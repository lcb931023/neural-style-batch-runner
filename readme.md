Neural Style Batch Runner
========

An interface to run a batch of neural style transfers at once.

Current Goal: Be able to run with the same content and style images, but varying combinations of parameters.

- Calculate and show number of tasks based on parameter combination
  - These would scale, so be careful...
  - is it possible to calculate an estimate of how long they'll take?
- Option to cancel the batch
